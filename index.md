### C criteria

- Take photos of the control interface

![originalelevator](report/images/originalelevator.png)

- Find the issues with the current design/Explain why it is bad.
1. Missing support for disability (e.g., it is too high for wheel chair people, missing support for blind people).
2. Missing several user feedback (current position, door opening, door closing, door opened, door closed, capacity and current weight).
3. Buttons are scattered in a large space (lost focus).

### Getting B:
- Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
Functionalities are indicated 
1. Select floor
2. 
- Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?

- How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?

- How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?

- What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?

- Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.

### Getting A

- Now, imagine that you can have a touch screen on the elevator

- Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?

- Design and implement interactive features

- Design and implement user feedback

### Extra credits:

- Your design supports people with disabilities

- You provide extra useful information on the display interface.

- Your imagination ...
